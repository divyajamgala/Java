Inputs:

The function squareNumber(int num) will receive one parameter:

- num : an integer which represents the number that the player has to square.

Outputs:

The function will return an integer - the square of num.

Example:

Sample Input:

squareNumber(7);

Sample Output:

49

Note:

In the sample input, the player is at a level where the number to square is 7. The square of this number is 7*7=49, so the function returns 49 as the output.
